This is an Android App demo which is going to apply all sorts of state-of-the-art technologies, including those are still in Alpha & Beta tests.

What would be included:
- Android Jetpack: Compose
- Android Jetpack: Navigation
- Android Jetpack: Paging
- Hilt
- OkHttp + Retrofit
- Coroutine

The architecture of the App would use MVVM, with layers:
- View
- View Model
- Use Case
- Repository
- Data Source

This would be a good example for Android App development in early 2021.

The App is yet to be developed, so hold on tight!
